# Fat-muscle segmentation

### Moose using Docker

##### Status : STOP

##### - The main user requirements need to get classified muscles categorically

##### - The result of this MOOSE process was divided into the 3 parts. Works properly, gets error and doesn't work properly.

##### - But the Thing was if it even works, it doesn't segmentate by categorical muscles. -> Doesn't satisfy the user requirements.

##### - Plus, I don't get the reason why some dicom files works or not and also get me error. 

##### - I investigated the origin dicom files for this but I couldn't see any obvious difference.

##### - The one thing that I felt was it needs enough length, but there is no any description of data. (LACK of knowledge about CT images and Dicom format)
